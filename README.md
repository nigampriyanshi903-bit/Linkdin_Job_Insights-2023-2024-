**Key Features and Workflow**
This project demonstrates a complete data workflow, from ingestion to visualization:

*1-Massive Data Handling & ETL*:

The raw dataset was extremely large, necessitating a detailed and efficient ETL pipeline (Python).

Only the cleaned, structured data is uploaded to ensure repository efficiency and focus on quality analysis.

*2-Advanced Data Quality Check*:

Thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed.

Specific focus was placed on checking Data Normality and detecting/treating Outliers in key numerical fields (e.g., salary, experience), ensuring the reliability of all subsequent analyses.

A dynamic and comprehensive dashboard was created using Power BI. This dashboard visualizes critical labor market insights, including:

Top demanding skills and job roles.

Geographical hiring distribution.

Salary trends and industry benchmarks.
